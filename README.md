# Pipeline Kubernetes Engine - PKE

PKE is an extremely simple [CNCF certifed](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/#logos) Kubernetes installer and distribution, designed to work on any cloud, VM or bare metal. The `pke` tool supports cloud provider integrations, multi-phased installs (requires only an OS), pre-warmed machine image builds, and more. PKE is the preferred Kubernetes run-time of the [Banzai Cloud Pipeline platform](https://beta.banzaicloud.io/), which supercharges the development, deployment and scaling of container-based applications with native support for multi-, hybrid-, and edge-cloud environments.

If you would like to supercharge your Kubernetes experience using Banzai Cloud Pipeline, check out the free developer beta:

## Creating PKE Kubernetes clusters on a Linux distribution

In order to run PKE, you need to meet the following requirements.

### Requirements

#### Operating system

`pke` currently is available for AlmaLinux 8.x, RHEL 8.x. and **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.

> We recommend using Ubuntu since it contains a much newer Kernel version. If you need support for an OS not listed above feel free to contact us.

#### Network

A flat network between nodes is required. Port `6443` (K8s API server) should be opened if there is a need to access K8s API externally.

#### The `pke` binary

You can download a particular binary release from the project's release page on [GitHub](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pke/releases). Our guides assume that the executable is available as `pke` in the system PATH.

You can also use the following commands as root to achieve this:


```
curl -vL https://banzaicloud.com/downloads/pke/latest -o /usr/local/bin/pke
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pke
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/
```

> Note that the `pke` tool will install all required dependencies (like CRI, CNI, etc).

### Single-node PKE

This will install a single Kuberentes master node and enables you to run workloads on it.

> At least 2 CPU cores are required and minimum of 512 MB of memory.

Creating a single-node Kubernetes cluster is as simple as running the following command as root:

`pke install single`

### Multi-node PKE

This setup consists a single Kubernetes master and at least one non-master node.

#### Master

> At least 2 CPU cores are required and minimum of 512 MB of memory.

To create the Kubernetes API server:

```bash
export MASTER_IP_ADDRESS=""
pke install master --kubernetes-api-server=$MASTER_IP_ADDRESS:6443
```

>Please get the token and certhash from the logs or issue the `pke token list` command to print the token and cert hash needed by workers to join the cluster.
>

#### Additional nodes

> At least 1 CPU core is required.

Once the API server is up and running you can add as many non-master nodes as needed:

```bash
export TOKEN=""
export CERTHASH=""
export MASTER_IP_ADDRESS=""
pke install worker --kubernetes-node-token $TOKEN --kubernetes-api-server-ca-cert-hash $CERTHASH --kubernetes-api-server $MASTER_IP_ADDRESS:6443
```

### Using `kubectl`

To use `kubectl` and other command line tools on the Kubernetes master, set up its config:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
kubectl get nodes
```

## Other options

You can create PKE clusters on any of the cloud providers, Vagrant, virtual machines, etc using the `pke` tool or let the [Pipeline platform](https://beta.banzaicloud.io/) do it for you using all the complementary features, such as: centralized log collection, federated monitoring, autoscaling, Vault based secret management, disaster recovery, security scans and a lot more.
